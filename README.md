## 🎵🖥️ Live Coding Music: Where Code Meets Melody 🖥️🎵

### 🚀 Introduction
Live coding music is an exciting fusion of programming and musical performance, where artists create and modify music in real-time by writing and altering code during a live show. It's like conducting an orchestra with a keyboard! 🎹💻

### 📜 A Brief History
The practice emerged in the early 2000s, rooted in:
• Algorithmic composition 🧮
• Computer music 🎚️
• Experimental performance art 🎭

### 🌟 Key Features
1. Real-time code execution ⚡
2. Algorithmic composition 🧠
3. Improvisation 🎭
4. Transparency (often projecting code) 🖥️
