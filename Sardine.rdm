Based on the information from the search results, here's an introduction to Sardine, incorporating details from its creator's GitHub repository:

## üêü Sardine: Python's Missing Algorave Module

Sardine is a versatile and user-friendly Python library designed for musical improvisation, algorithmic composition, and live coding performances. Created by Bubobubobubobubo, Sardine transforms your standard Python interpreter into a powerful musical instrument[4].

### üåü Key Features

1. **Musical Creativity**: Create and map melodic and rhythmic patterns to electronic instruments using MIDI, OSC, and SuperCollider[4].

2. **Time-Aware Python**: Employ temporal recursion to make Python code time and tempo-aware, allowing for precise musical timing[4].

3. **Audiovisual Performance**: Develop intricate audiovisual performances with MIDI and OSC I/O capabilities[4].

4. **Synchronization**: Easily synchronize with other computers and musical instruments using MIDI Clocks and the Link Protocol[4].

5. **SuperDirt Integration**: Utilize bindings for SuperDirt, a popular audio engine among live coders[4].

### üöÄ Installation

To install Sardine, ensure you have Python 3.10 or later, then run:

```bash
pip install sardine
```

### üèä The `swim` Function

While not explicitly mentioned in the search results, Sardine likely uses functions or decorators for creating musical patterns. Here's a hypothetical example of how a `swim` function might work in Sardine:

```python
from sardine import *

@swim
def bass_pattern(time, steps):
    N('c3', dur=1/4)
    N('e3', dur=1/4)
    N('g3', dur=1/4)
    N('b3', dur=1/4)
```

This example demonstrates how Sardine might allow you to define repeating musical patterns using Python functions.

### ü§ù Community and Contributions

Sardine is in its early stages of development and actively seeks contributors. Whether you're interested in code, documentation, or have ideas to share, the Sardine community welcomes your involvement. You can connect with the community through Discord, GitHub, or by sending a private message to the creator[4].

Sardine represents an exciting intersection of Python programming and live music performance, offering a powerful platform for exploring algorithmic composition and real-time musical creativity.
